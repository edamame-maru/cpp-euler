# Project Euler
## What is Project Euler?

https://projecteuler.net/about:
>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
>
>The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Enviroment Setup
Microsoft:
>C++ is a compiled language meaning your program's source code must be translated (compiled) before it can be run on your computer. The C/C++ extension doesn't include a C++ compiler or debugger, since VS Code as an editor relies on command-line tools for the development workflow. You need to install these tools or use the tools already installed on your computer.

Get started with C++ Programming with Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

Install a compiler, then translate your code with ```g++ <yourfile.cpp> -o <youroutputfile>``` or ```clang <yourfile.cpp>``` according to your installed compilier. In this repository, reference files will be compiled into ```.exe``` files for portability on windows. For local testing on other systems, please compile the ```.cpp``` file. **For the best development experience, Arch/Debian Linux or Windows 10/11 is recommended.**
