## Enviroment Setup
Microsoft:
>C++ is a compiled language meaning your program's source code must be translated (compiled) before it can be run on your computer. The C/C++ extension doesn't include a C++ compiler or debugger, since VS Code as an editor relies on command-line tools for the development workflow. You need to install these tools or use the tools already installed on your computer.

You can then run ```g++ <yourfile.cpp> -o <youroutputfile>``` or ```clang <yourfile.cpp>``` according to your compilier. In this repository, most files will be compiled into ```.exe``` files for portability on windows. **For the best development enviroment, we recomend windows or Debian/Arch linux.**
